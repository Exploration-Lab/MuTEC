I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it .

Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency !,Don ' t judge a book by its cover . Do you know what it ' s about ?,"I can ' t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! Why not ! It ' s a classic . In fact , it ' s one of my favorite novels . But it ' s so old . Don ' t judge a book by its cover . Do you know what it ' s about ? No , not at all . First of all , it ' s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . I didn ' t realize it was a romance novel . What ' s the main storyline ? It ' s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . Why does he want to do that ? Since he doesn ' t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . Won ' t they get his inheritance ? No , that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ' t so horrible after all . So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? There ' s movie ? My teacher didn ' t tell me that ! That ' s probably because she wants you to read the book first . It would take a lot less time ... How about this . When you finish the book . I ' ll get the movie and watch it with you . Ok . That sounds like a deal .",happiness,0,dailydialog_va_710_utt_1_impossible_cause_utt_2

Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! That's not very fair . What did you do ? There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ? Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders .

"No , you don ' t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ' s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ' s gonna kill me !","Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?","Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ? I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . Really ? Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . Why did they want to found a college ? Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . Oh , I see . Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you . You can ask me any question at any time .",fear,0,dailydialog_va_710_utt_5_impossible_cause_utt_2

I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ' m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ' absurd ! I am sorry , sir , there ' s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either . Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . Let ' s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars .

I don't think you really want to hear about it . It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! Why ? What happened ? Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! That's not very fair . What did you do ? There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders . I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . That's so true .

Thank you .,Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .,"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ? I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . Really ? Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . Why did they want to found a college ? Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . Oh , I see . Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you . You can ask me any question at any time .",happiness,0,dailydialog_va_835_utt_6_impossible_cause_utt_4

He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .

"I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd .","This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .","What's wrong ? I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's "" chi "" . But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .",happiness,0,dailydialog_va_474_utt_4_impossible_cause_utt_4

Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us .,Not funny .,"Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? It ' s a skill . What can I say ? I don ' t know why , I just have a long routine . Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ' re out the door . Half an hour , tops . Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?

But it wasn ' t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . That ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about that .

If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money .

The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ? No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home ! What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude ! I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around . I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ? I guess so . So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend .

Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ?

"Well , I think you look nice today too .",I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !,"I don ' t know what I ' m going to do ! It ' s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! Don ' t worry . I don't think you ' re going to lose your job over one mistake . It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . But it wasn ' t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . That ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth . Let ' s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ' d rather invest my money somehow . Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ? Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year . Well , that ' s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work . If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money . I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !",happiness,0,dailydialog_va_491_utt_6_impossible_cause_utt_4
