I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . is that so ?

First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . Oh , OK . Wow ! OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . Wow . That sounds really good .",happiness,0,dailydialog_va_410_utt_12_impossible_cause_utt_2

It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? History . Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers .

It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . What ? Are you serious ? Yes . But nobody uses Macintosh ! That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma Yes , I'm from Taiwan . Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .

OK .,I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !,"I don ' t know what I ' m going to do ! It ' s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! Don ' t worry . I don't think you ' re going to lose your job over one mistake . It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . But it wasn ' t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . That ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth . Let ' s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ' d rather invest my money somehow . Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ? Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year . Well , that ' s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work . If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money .

You ' re welcome .,"You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help .","Can I help you ? Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3 . It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? History . Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your Thirty percent ? Yes . Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? Yes . It's an excellent system . Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . What ? Are you serious ? Yes . But nobody uses Macintosh ! That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma Yes , I'm from Taiwan . Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help .",happiness,0,dailydialog_va_184_utt_13_impossible_cause_utt_1

Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother .

Do you like surfing ? I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ? We've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money .

I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . People can ' t have it both ways .
